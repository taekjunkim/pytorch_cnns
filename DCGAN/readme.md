# Generate faces using GAN

GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. They are made of two distinct models, a generator and a discriminator. The job of the generator is to spawn ‘fake’ images that look like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is constantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and better fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better detective and correctly classify the real and fake images.
